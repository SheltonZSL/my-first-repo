## Why Me? & About me

I am a sophomore undergraduate student in the Department of Computing at Queen's University in Canada. During my freshman year, I was not a computer science student but was involved in a university course in computing because of my interest. I entered the computing program in my sophomore year because I was very interested in computers. My first contact with computer programming language was Python, so my primary programming language is python, followed by java, and during my sophomore year, I learned PostgreSQL statements. I know some computer knowledge of databases. And I can use Docker tool and know how to build a runtime environment in docker.

The reason why I chose this project is that I am interested in Skywalking and Flink. I had made some contributions to skywalking before and briefly understood the project content of Skywalking. I want to contribute more to Skywalking's project. As for Flink, a distributed processing engine, I have done some understanding before. It can help Skywalking process user log files very well. But processing these log files and displaying them better requires an algorithmic model. I've looked at the algorithmic model of drain3, and I think it's a good fit for my GSoC project. Therefore, I was a good fit for this Skywalking Flink project. This is why I chose this project and why I could be chosen for this project.



## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

# about Flink

Skywalking is an application performance monitoring (APM) tool for distributed systems, which supports functions such as distributed link tracing, application performance monitoring, metrics analysis and logging. This project is to improve SkyWalking's log monitoring and log output, so that users can better observe logs and troubleshoot errors. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer the log files in protobuf format output by Skywalking to Kafka.


Kafka is a distributed message queuing system. SkyWalking uses Kafka to transmit data from Agent to server. Specifically, SkyWalking uses Kafka as the middleware for data transmission to send data from the Agent to the server. Therefore, the role of kafka is important. However, only by
